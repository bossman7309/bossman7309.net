Welcome to the new website. It is not 100% complete yet but at a stage where I
am happy for it to replace the previous one. So, expect further changes to the
site for a little while.

The new Wiki contains a page for every package in the repositories. Some of
these pages are rather bare but this will improve alongside the existing manual
page effort $/kisslinux/repo/issues/273

Expect more frequent updates from me about KISS in this new tidbits page. I will
also be adding an RSS feed here for folks interested. If there are any issues
with the new website, let me know @/contact

PS The new FAQ page at @/answers needs filling in. Send me questions and
   (if suitable) I will answer them on this page.

PPS The README files for each package will be checked into the repository
    shortly. For now they exist solely on the website.
