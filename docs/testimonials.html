TESTIMONIALS
________________________________________________________________________________

Here's what people are saying about KISS!


> I just find it interesting that their version of simple includes
  dependency-tracking package management but excludes Spanish.

> Just wanted to say this looks kickass. It is way easier to tear
  things down than to build them.

> I was looking for something like this actually, I thought I would
  finally have to warm up to BSD if I wanted an OS that I have some
  hope of understanding fully.

> Ooh, this is one of those artisan, hand-crafted websites! I'll
  have to post this to my Instagram. I once met an old web developer
  in the south of France who would wash the bytes by hand before
  uploading them to his server. Said it was a family tradition
  passed down for generations.

> I've got a basic installation done! It was actually quite simple!
  Not much is set up, but getting the base down was arguably simpler
  than Arch, and far simpler than Gentoo. I'm not really familiar
  with Busybox, or musl at all, so this should be fun!

> Keep making the biggest problem of Linux bigger, please... Yeah,
  this problem is "fragmentation", and it is not solved with
  "simplicity".

> Oh this touches something deep in me.

> "This distribution has no default desktop or window manager
  environment." - goes to prove that "simple" doesn't mean "easy to
  use"...

> This sounds awesome and very interesting. Going to have try this
  on one of my spare laptops....

> Just what we need, another Linux distribution. Spread the effort
  even more thinly.

> I spent some time on their website, and this really is a wonder
  distribution.

> Literally the opposite of KISS. At lest don't use hypocritical
  excuses for your crusades.

> KISS Linux is a really interesting effort and a sign, IMO, of a
  healthy ecosystem, so I commend Dylan and other contributors for
  their efforts. Great to hear about the aarch64/ppc64le support
  too!

> Ok, whatâ€™s your point. You have have musl and libc on a system.
  Not to mention the developer of kids is a outspoken anti systemd
  fud spreader.

> The strength of being simple and small is that I'm in control of
  my own system. When my package manager or init daemon is doing
  something wrong, or is not behaving how I expected it, I can just
  open the shell script and find out why in a few minutes.

> One nice thing about KISS is that everything is hackable and the
  system is small enough, such that mere mortals can wrap their
  heads around it.

> Just as I thought. No actual simplicity, just some neckbeards
  complaining about software evolving in the last 20 years.

> Because of how simple KISS Linux it is, being written completely
  on POSIX shell and all. The entire distro is able to live in just
  one directory in /var. That allows me to base my entire system on
  literally anything I want.

> Well all I can say is grandma won't be installing kiss any time
  soon, looking at the instructions.

> Not gonna lie, the attitude of the maintainer kinda makes my skin
  crawl, but to each their own.
